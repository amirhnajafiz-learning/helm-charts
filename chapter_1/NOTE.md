# Chapter 1

First install Rust and Cargo using the following link.

- [rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- VS Code rust-analyzer extention

Rust files have `.rs` extention. As every programming language needs a config file, rust uses `Cargo.toml` as its config file.

You can compile a rust file by running `rustc file.rs`. Moreover, it's better to use Cargo in order to work with Rust.

Cargo is Rust package manager. It can be used to build new projects, compile them, and run them. Some of it's useful commands are:

```sh
cargo new project
cargo build
cargo run
cargo check
```
